// This function should load the csv file in fileName into a heap file (see

// delimited and has a header If the file doesn't exist or can't be opened, or
// the field doesn't exist, or the field is not and integer, should return an
// err. Note that when you create a HeapFile, you will need to supply a file
// name;  you can supply a non-existant file, in which case it will be created.
// However, subsequent invocations of this method will result in tuples being
// reinserted into this file unless you delete (e.g., with [os.Remove] it before
// calling NewHeapFile.
